# TetrisGame
##About:
Our teamâ€™s plan is to make a Tetris game using Swift and its library, IGIS. We will also use Vapor to export them. Our Tetris is planned to have those basic features of a Tetris game such as a board to contain all the color-coded, falling blocks, a rotating and moving system, and line removal when a line is completely filled. If we still have time, we will make the block fall faster when the user wants to, the scoring system, pause, see the next block, or even music.
